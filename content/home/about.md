I am a post doc in the Centre of Australian Category Theory at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au).  
I work on operad-like structures and their higher analogues. In particular, modular operads, compact closed categories (and other structures described by graphs with cycles) and their applications, particularly in topology.
