I am a post doc in the [Centre of Australian Category Theory](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/) at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au).  
I work on operad-like structures and their higher analogues. In particular, modular operads, compact closed categories (and other structures described by graphs with cycles) and their applications, particularly in topology.  
I'm currently building a new site that will be up shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience.
