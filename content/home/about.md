# Sophie Raynor

I am a post doc in the Centre of Australian Category Theory at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au).  
I work on operad-like structures and their higher analogues. In particular, modular operads, compact closed categories (and other structures described by graphs with cycles) and their applications, particularly in topology.  


I acknowledge the traditional custodians of the Macquarie University Land, the Wattamattageal clan of the Darug nation, 
whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue to nurture this land.
 I pay my respects to Elders past, present and future.
