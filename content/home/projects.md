I'm particularly interested in modular operads and other structures described by graphs admitting cycles. Watch this space for more notes on loops and sphere contractions.

I'm also keen on weak (modular) operads, and always interested in thinking about generalised associahedra and their symmetries.


Right now, I'm in the process of building a site with more detailed and accessible information on my research. 
Until then, feel free to take a look at the following:

- Here is my paper on [Brauer categories and circuit algebras](files/COWebV1.pdf). (There are still a couple of references missing, and it's being read again for typos.)
- Here are annotated [slides](files/OcHoTopJuly21.pdf) from my talk on that paper at OcHoTop, Lille, 7 July 2021.

- Here is the most up-to-date version of my paper on a [distributive law for modular operads](files/MO210412.pdf) (CSMs) to appear in Advances in Mathematics.
- Here are some Australian Category Seminar talk slides on work extending that paper:
[Graphs and nerves for circuit operads](files/2020_10_21_AusCat_circuits.pdf), 21 October 2020,
[Graphs and nerves for compact closed categories](files/2020_10_28AusCat_CompactNerve.pdf), 28 October 2020,
[An operadic model structure for compact closed categories](files/2020_11_04_AusCat_OperadicModel.pdf), 5 November 2020.



- Here is my preprint together with L. Bonatto, S. Chettih, A. Linton, M. Robertson and N. Wahl on a [weak operad of normalised cacti](files/InfinityCacti-arXiv-version1c.pdf). 

- 11 August 2020, [Operads Pop-up](http://operads.com/). [Talk slides](files/Operads_popup.pdf).


Some version of my cv is [here](files/cv.pdf) (though it may be a little out of date). 

Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about loops, sphere contractions, or anything else related to the topics mentioned above. 

I'm also keen to hear from others interested in questions of representation and retention in maths. Especially to share thoughts on `speaking to power' to address persistent bias in the academy. And the possibility (or not?) of ethical outreach. 

It's easy to be too overwhelmed to sit down and read about these issues. If that's the case, why not listen to the [Mathematically Uncensored](https://minoritymath.org/mathematically-uncensored/) podcast from the [Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Sciences](https://minoritymath.org/) on your commute? (I also recommend listening if you're not overwhelmed with reading.)

 <!-- I'm always curious to know about any work on feedback loops, recursion, fixed points. -->

More soon!
