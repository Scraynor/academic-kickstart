I'm particularly interested in modular operads and other structures described by graphs admitting cycles. Watch this space for more notes on loops and sphere contractions.

I'm also keen on weak (modular) operads, and always interested in thinking about generalised associahedra and their symmetries.


Right now, I'm in the process of building a site with more detailed and accessible information on my research. 
Until then, feel free to take a look at the following:

- This is the most up-to-date version of my paper on a [distributive law for modular operads](files/MO210412.pdf).  

- Here are some Australian Category Seminar talk slides on work extending that paper:
[Graphs and nerves for circuit operads](files/2020_10_21_AusCat_circuits.pdf), 21 October 2020,
[Graphs and nerves for compact closed categories](files/2020_10_28AusCat_CompactNerve.pdf), 28 October 2020,
[An operadic model structure for compact closed categories](files/2020_11_04_AusCat_OperadicModel.pdf), 5 November 2020.



- Here is my preprint together with L. Bonatto, S. Chettih, A. Linton, M. Robertson and N. Wahl on a [weak operad of normalised cacti](files/InfinityCacti-arXiv-version1c.pdf). 

- 11 August 2020, [Operads Pop-up](http://operads.com/). [Talk slides](files/Operads_popup.pdf).


You can find my cv [here](files/cv.pdf). 

Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about loops, sphere contractions, or anything else related to the topics mentioned above. 

I'm also keen to hear from others interested in questions of representation and retention in maths. Especially to share thoughts on `speaking to power' to address persistent bias in the academy. 

 <!-- I'm always curious to know about any work on feedback loops, recursion, fixed points. -->

More soon!
