 I'm in the process of building a site with more detailed and accessible information on my research. 
Until then, feel free to take a look at the following:

- This is the most up-to-date version (update 28/08/20) of my paper on a [distributive law for modular operads](files/2020_08_28ModOp.pdf) (CSMs).  Please note, this version is still being proofread.

- Here is my preprint together with L. Bonatto, S. Chettih, A. Linton, M. Robertson and N. Wahl on a [weak operad of normalised cacti](files/InfinityCacti-arXiv-version1c.pdf). 

- 11 August 2020, [Operads Pop-up](http://operads.com/). [Talk slides](files/Operads_popup.pdf).


You can find my cv [here](files/cv.pdf). 

Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about loops, sphere contractions, or anything else related to the topics mentioned above. I'm also keen to hear from others interested in questions of (neuro)diversity and retention in maths. 
<!-- I'm always curious to know about any work on feedback loops, recursion, fixed points. -->

More soon!
