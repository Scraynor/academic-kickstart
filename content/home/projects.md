 I'm in the process of building a site with more detailed and accessible information on my research. 
Until then, feel free to take a look at the following:

- Here is the most up-to-date version of my paper on a [distributive law for modular operads](files/2020_08_19_modOp.pdf) (CSMs).  Please note, this is an unfinished draft and has not yet been proofread.

- My preprint together with L. Bonatto, S. Chettih, A. Linton, M. Robertson and N. Wahl on a weak operad of normalised cacti is [here](files/InfinityCacti-arXiv-version1c.pdf).

- 11 August 2020, [Operads Pop-up](http://operads.com/). [Talk slides](files/Operads_popup.pdf).


You can find my cv [here](files/cv.pdf). 

Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about loops, sphere contractions, or anything else related to the topics mentioned above. I'm also keen to hear from others interested in questions of (neuro)diversity and retention in maths. 
<!-- I'm always curious to know about any work on feedback loops, recursion, fixed points. -->

More soon!
