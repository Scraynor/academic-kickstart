I am a post doc in the [Centre of Australian Category Theory](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/) at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au).  
I work on operad-like structures, their higher analogues, and their applications, particularly in topology.

I'm particularly interested in structures described by graphs admitting cycles. modular operads, compact closed categories, and other structures described by graphs admitting cycles.
