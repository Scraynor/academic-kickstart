interests:
- Operad Theory (in particular modular operads)
- Higher (modular) operads
- Applications in mathematics and beyond


about:
- Here is my paper on [Brauer categories and circuit algebras](files/COWebV1.pdf). (There are still a couple of references missing, and it's being read again for typos.)
- Here is the most up-to-date version of my paper on a [distributive law for modular operads](files/MO210412.pdf) (CSMs) to appear in Advances in Mathematics.

I am a post doc in the Centre of Australian Category Theory at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au) working on operad-like structures, their higher analogues, and their applications, in topology, algebra, and the real world...  


I acknowledge the traditional custodians of the Macquarie University Land, the Wattamattageal clan of the Darug nation, 
whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue to nurture this land. 

I pay my respects to Elders past, present and future.
