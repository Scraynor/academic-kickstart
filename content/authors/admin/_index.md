I am a post doc in the [Centre of Australian Category Theory] at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au).  
I work on operad-like structures, their higher analogues, and their applications, particularly in topology.

I'm particularly interested in [modular operads](files/2020.08.09ModOpsDistributive.pdf) and other structures described by graphs admitting cycles. Watch this space for more notes on loops and sphere contractions.

I'm also keen on weak (modular) [operads](files/InfinityCacti-arXiv-version1c.pdf), and always keen to think about generalised associahedra and their symmetries.
